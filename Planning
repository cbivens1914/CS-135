Problems:
  Displaying menu
    printf shit 
    switch statement based on userchoice 
    
  Changing difficulty
    based on second user choice for difficulty
    switch statement (based on difficulty selection)
    either based on changing a variable that sets the size of the index (doesn't require switch), or three separate functions for each case
  Randomly assigning characters to cards
    ???
  Prompting for user card choice and saving it
    user inputs coordinates
    check coordinates to see if they are the same
      run function called checkCards
  Updating user score
    score = number of cards (comes from difficulty)
    if the cards chosen by the user have the same character, does nothing if so. If not, decrement score by 1
    could happen in side checkCards function or be a separate function based on the return value of checkChards
  Saving scores - only ten
    giving option
    prompting for and saving name if user chooses yes
    save score and name to score document
      make a score document if it doesn't exist
    sorting scores
  Viewing scores
    displaying scores and names from score document to the user
      fprintf
    dont crash if score document doesn't exst
